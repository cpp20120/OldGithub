# This is backup of ald projects

!!! DO NOT USE THIS AS LEARNING MATERIAL

This repository contains archived versions of old projects, saved for historical
reference purposes. Most of the code here is outdated and does not meet current
development standards.

## ðŸ“Œ Important warnings

- **This is not production code** - everything here should be considered as an example of "how not to do"
- **Outdated technologies** - many projects use deprecated libraries and vulnerable dependencies
- **"- **"- **"- **" What is this ****?"** - in some places the code is so bad that even now I don't remember what it was written under.
- **Tests? What kind of tests?** - most projects do not have tests

Yes, it hurts to look at it now, but it was my way.
